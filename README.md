## 📖 About
**FairPick** is a modern replacement for the traditional "names in a bowl" method. Whether you are managing a monthly **Bhishi / Kitty Party**, picking a volunteer for a team stand-up, or deciding who pays for lunch, FairPick makes it fair, fun, and transparent.

What makes this project unique is its development story: **It was built entirely using Generative AI.** The logic, physics engine, and UI were developed through a prompt-engineering dialogue, turning a concept into a deployed app in record time.

## ✨ Salient Features

- **🎭 Physics-Based Animation:** Watch actual virtual chits fall, scatter, and unfold on a 3D canvas.
- **💰 Money Manager (Bhishi Mode):** Tracks contributions, calculates total pots, and splits prize money (₹).
- **🧠 Smart History:** Remembers previous winners to prevent repeats until a cycle is reset.
- **👥 Multi-Group Support:** Manage separate lists for "Office," "Family," and "Friends."
- **🔒 Privacy First:** **100% Offline.** Data is stored in your browser's local storage. No servers, no tracking.
- **📱 PWA Ready:** Works seamlessly on Mobile (iOS/Android) and Desktop.
